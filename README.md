# HR-Turnover-Analysis

#### HR turnover analysis was carried out using four different modeling method: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XgBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM). By Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression can achieve great accuracy with only 14 features, while it turned out to be overfitting to the model based on this perticular dataset. In the future, a more general bining group should be generated.

#### Compared with the long and complexed Feature Engineering methods, Random Forest, XgBoost and SVM all demonstrated excellent accuracy after parameter optimization. In particular, Random Forest behaved the best to achieve around 99% accuracy. Although the dataset is imbalanced, the prediction redults seemed not to be affected. For typical classification examples, it would be feasible to try Random Forest, XgBoost and SVM at first to improve the efficiency.
